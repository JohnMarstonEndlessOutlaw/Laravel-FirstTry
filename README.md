  - Pepe is just an empty laravel proyect for initiate the laravel server with docker
  - The docker-compose.yml will generate the laravel server container, mysql container and phpmyadmin container
  - You must exec the pepe_laravel container and run php artasian migrate for the database don't give you "sqlstate[42s02]: base table or view not found laravel"
